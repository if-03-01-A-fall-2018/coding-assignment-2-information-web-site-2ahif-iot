        <h2>Security and hacked devices</h2>
        <p>Devices for average end consumers just have to work.<br>
        Because of that, securing the devices often isn't that much of a topic for the manufacturers.</p>

        <h3>Passwords: The never ending problem</h3>
        <p><b>Default credentials are almost the biggest problem.</b><br>
          In 2016, a bot net called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)">Mirai</a> scanned the entire internet.<br>
          After finding IoT devices like TVs, DVRs, routers or CCTV-cameras it tried to login and infect those with malicious code.</p>

        <p>Here's a list of the passwords tried by Mirai:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>root / root</li>
          <li>root / admin</li>
          <li>root / 1234</li>
          <li>admin / admin</li>
          <li>admin / password</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As you can see, these passwords are not secure at all.</p>
        <p>In October 2016, the Mirai bot net executed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Dyn_cyberattack">DDoS attack to Dyn</a>'s DNS servers.<br>
        Websites like Amazon, GitHub, Slack, Twitter, Spotify and more were down for several hours.</p>

        <h3>Forwarded ports</h3>
        <p>Port forwardings are a major issue too.<br>Without forwarded ports, Mirai wouldn't have happened.</p>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#Problems_with_UPnP">UPnP</a> is a protocol for easier port handling.<br>
        It does not require any authentication - any device can forward ports.</p>
        <p>IoT search engines use exactly this issue.<br>
          These search engines scan the entire net for open ports and add them to their search index.<br>
        Here's a screenshot of the most popular one, <a href="https://www.shodan.io">shodan.io</a>.</p>
